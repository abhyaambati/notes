PYTORCH

- open source deep learning network by Meta
- used for : research, ai applications, and production

why?
- easy to learn ( like numpy, but w gpu support )
- dynamic computation graph ( easier to debug than tensorflow )
- great for nlp and computer vision ( cnns, transformers, GANs, RL)

- Has better tensors and better efficient operations than numpy
- Has GPU support (CUDA)

- AutoGrad ( Automatic Differentiation )
- autograd enables automatic gradient computation for training neural networks
- Gradient in neural networks is used to optimise ( minimise ) the loss function and updates weights in the direction as necessary for optimization with gradient descent

- CUDA ( Compute Unified Device Architecture ) : parallel cloud computing platform and programming model developed by Nvidia that enables users to use GPU cores for parallel processing
for general purpose computing
